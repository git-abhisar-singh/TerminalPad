# TerminalPad

### The home screen for AI coding agents on Mac.

**Launch Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Ollama, OpenCode and every AI coding CLI instantly — one shortcut, no commands to remember.**

A free, open-source **AI CLI launcher for macOS**. Click a tile (or type and hit Enter) and it launches in a new Terminal window — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Antigravity, Ollama, and every CLI tool you've installed.

## Why

You keep typing `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, `gemini --yolo`, `ollama run …` into a terminal. TerminalPad is the **launcher for AI coding agents**: it turns those into a searchable grid, so getting into the right agent is one shortcut away instead of a remembered command. Each agent gets its real logo and one tile per mode. Every other CLI you've installed (scrcpy, ffmpeg, gh, docker, …) is auto-discovered and added too.

## Features

- **Launchpad grid** of agents — pure dark, transparent panel. Real Liquid Glass on macOS 26, a clean dark blur everywhere else.
- **Spotlight search** — opens focused. Type to filter, `↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` launches the top match, `Esc` clears/closes.
- **Per-mode tiles** — `claude` vs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` vs `claude -c` each get their own icon and color.
- **Real logos** — fetched from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org), rendered white on glass. ~50 ship bundled; unknown tools fetch on demand and cache.
- **Auto-discovery** — scans `brew leaves`, npm globals, pipx, and `cargo`/`go`/`bun`/`~/.local/bin`, adding every installed CLI with a matched logo (or a clean monogram fallback). Results are cached, so the grid is instant on launch and rescans in the background.
- **JSON config** — edit `~/.config/terminalpad/agents.json` to add agents/modes. No rebuild.

## Install

Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later — Apple Silicon or Intel — and the Swift toolchain (`xcode-select --install` is enough, no full Xcode needed). On macOS 26 (Tahoe) you get real Liquid Glass; on earlier versions it falls back to a clean dark panel.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/git-abhisar-singh/TerminalPad.git
cd TerminalPad
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` builds the app and drops it in `/Applications`. Because you compile it yourself, there's no Gatekeeper warning — no Apple Developer account or signing required.

Prefer to do it by hand?

```bash
./build.sh
mv TerminalPad.app /Applications/
```

First time you launch an agent, macOS asks **"TerminalPad wants to control Terminal."** Click **Allow** (it's how it opens a new Terminal window).

## Configure

`~/.config/terminalpad/agents.json` is seeded on first run. Add or edit agents, then hit the ⟳ button (or relaunch):

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Claude Code",
      "icon": "CC",
      "color": "#D97757",
      "logo": "claude",
      "variants": [
        { "label": "Normal",           "command": "claude",                                "icon": "play.fill", "color": "#D97757" },
        { "label": "Skip Permissions",  "command": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions", "icon": "bolt.fill", "color": "#F4A261" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Display name |
| `icon` | 1–2 char monogram (shown when no logo) |
| `color` | Tile accent (hex) |
| `logo` | Logo slug → `Resources/logos/<slug>.png`, else fetched from Simple Icons |
| `variants[].command` | The exact shell command run in Terminal |
| `variants[].icon` | [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) name |

## How it works

- **Launch** — runs `osascript` to `tell application "Terminal" to do script "<command>"` in a login shell, so your normal `PATH` resolves the binary.
- **Logos** — `logos.py` pulls black SVGs from Simple Icons, rasterizes via macOS `qlmanage`, and keys white→transparent. At runtime `LogoStore` does the same in Swift (CoreImage) for tools discovered later.
- **Discovery** — `Discovery.swift` runs `brew leaves`, npm, and pipx in parallel, resolves each formula to its real binary, skips libraries, and builds a tile per tool. The last scan is cached to `~/.config/terminalpad/discovered.json` and painted instantly while a fresh scan runs in the background.
- **Build** — `build.sh` compiles the SwiftUI sources with `swiftc` and assembles the `.app` bundle by hand (no Xcode project).
